**tree_grow()** function is written accordingly with the code structure as below:
```
tree_grow <- function(table, nmin, minleaf, nfeat) {
  
  # nodelist <- {{training data}}
  nodelist <- list(table)
  
  # the model of the trained tree
  tree_nodelist <- list()
  tree_index <- 0
  
  repeat{
    
    # current_node <- select node from nodelist
    current_node <- nodelist[[1]]
    # nodelist <- nodelist - current node
    nodelist[[1]] <- NULL
    
    # If impurity(current node) > 0 AND observations(current node) >= nmin, the current node is allowed to be split.
    if(impurity_by_gini_index(current_node[,nfeat+1]) > 0 && length(current_node[,1]) >= nmin) {
      
      # S <- set of candidate splits in current node
      # s* <- argmax {impurity reduction(s, current node)}, where s is in S
      for(feat in 1:nfeat) {
        result <- bestsplit(current_node[,feat], current_node[,nfeat+1])

        # If the current node is pure
        # Append the current node as the terminal node to the tree model by its pure label.
        tree_index <- tree_index + 1
        tree_nodelist[[tree_index]] <- c(NA, NA, current_node[1,nfeat+1])
